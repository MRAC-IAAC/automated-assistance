 This project started as a research about how to improve time and material resources in construction sites.
 Based on previous researchs, is possible to find construction workers can only contribute  with 29% or their time productive labor. Rest of the working time
 is wasted in material waiting, tool waiting, material handling and movement.
 
 How improve working time and help to increase production rates?
 
 ## Requirements

 -Raspberry camera
 -OpenCV phyton 
 -Zbar code reader

 ## Getting started 
 Analizing the actual behaviour in construction sites, we designed a protocol for tool demand and deliver.
 ![Alt Text]()
 First install OpenCV on Raspberry Pi and the libraries for face recognition 
 
 ## Workflow 
 In this diagrams is possible to see process of the different steps done.
